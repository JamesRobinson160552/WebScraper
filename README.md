# WebScraper

# I'm learning more about web scraping! 
# The current end goal of this is to gather training data for a classifier based on r/AmItheAsshole posts.
# The classifier will take a story and decide if the user would be declared an asshole by reddit.
# The project is in the 'AITA' directory.
# The classifier is stored on Google Drive as an ipynb at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BTUiFy8P8xo5Qz9TzK-hXYH2odGH4thq?usp=sharing
