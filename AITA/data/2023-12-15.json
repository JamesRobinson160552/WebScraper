I tried calling the parents of the kids again, but they still weren't picking up or responding.At 11.30 ish I called the police, because I didn't know what else to do. And I  was worried something might have happened to the parents too. They came, and around the same time the parents came back. The dad screamed at me, and he's still very upset.Edit: I called the police because I was worried about the parents not picking up / being late, and because I really had to get home. Not to involve cps or anything like that.Edit 2: since some people asked. I didn't call the emergency number, I'm not in the US (police isn't violent here), and I was paid up front, so not for the extra 3 hours.

Stepdad focused a lot of his time providing for us so I never got close to him but I am grateful for him. I am engaged and my sister is going to marry in about a month. My wedding will be in a year. Both of us are close to our mom though.My sister who I will call Noelle, fucked up in my opinion. At first I was on her side but now I just feel bad for stepdad. Noelle isn�t going to have him walk her down and give her away. I understand this is her decision and when that came out I helped my mom and stepdad understand that it was her choice. The turning point happened last week when she told us that he will not be sitting at the family table, when asked her why she made it clear he wasn�t family to her. Again her right but damn he is the reason we had such a good childhood and are debt free ( he paid for college and worked a ton).I knew this would result in them not going to the wedding and they informed my sister. She called me upset and was ranting about how it was her wedding. That she was being abandoned. I had enough and told her she is an idiot if she didn�t think her actions wouldn�t have consequences. She called me a jerk and hung upI am unsure if I was a jerk and I feel guilty since I am now closer to my parents since I promised he can walk me down at my wedding.",

	"body" : "My half sister and I share a mom. She's 9 years older than me (17f). Her dad died when she was 5, mom remarried to my dad when she was 8 and got pregnant with me straight away. Until I was 10 I thought she was the best person ever and I wanted us to have a relationship like my friends had with their siblings. But she has rejected me as \"not being her real sister\" from day one. She also rejects my dad as anything other than \"my mother's fuck buddy\" and she has called him that to his face and in front of other people. My dad always lets it slide and mom will tell her we're a family, to which my half sister will say she's family but my dad and I are not.When I was 6 my brother was stillborn when mom was about 6 months pregnant with him. She had grandma come over to watch my half sister and me while she was in the hospital and we were told something happened to our brother. I was really upset because I had been so excited and wanted comfort from my half sister. She told me to grow the fuck up and stay away from her. She also told me it was a shame the same thing didn't happen when mom was expecting me. Grandma was horrified and told her she would regret saying that but my half sister told her she wouldn't regret saying that about someone she didn't love.The breaking point was that Christmas when I was 10. She decided to stay with a different family member for Christmas but did show up to our grandparents for Christmas Day celebrations. I was excited to see her and thought the fact she showed up meant she might like me now. But after I had tried talking to her she turned on me and said she didn't give a fuck about me or my life and did not want me to know anything about hers. She called me pathetic and asked why she would care about someone like me. She told me if she could turn back time she would have begged for mom to have an abortion with me because I was disgusting. It was that point where I think I hit the point where I was like you know what, fine.Over the last 7 years I have seen her maybe 3 times. She avoids being where I will be and she has made it clear to mom that if mom wants to see her, dad and I are not welcome and we are not invited into her life. Except now she's getting married and she invited me and wanted me there because questions were asked. Mom was so happy when my half sister told her she really wanted me there. Mom was so eager to tell me. My half sister even showed up to invite me personally. But I told her I would not go. She explained she needed me and why and I told her I will not make her look better by showing up. I said she wants me dead, I don't want her in my life, it's as simple as that.Mom cried that we're siblings and I told her I lost my only sibling when my brother was stillborn. That he would have been my only sibling, because my half sister sure as shit wasn't a sibling for me. She made it clear many times over she did not want to be.My half sister and mom both feel I'm really in the wrong.AITA?",

She's a mommy blogger and embraces the  \"white, beige\" aesthetic. This preference reflects in every room of her apartment, including seasonal decorations, and she's quite intense about it.I've never said anything to her about it as it brings her joy.Some months ago, I stumbled upon a TikTok channel where a woman adopts a fake German accent to \"review\" fashion for what she calls \"sad beige babies.\" I think it is really funny. It has become an I side joke at our home.During our recent visit to her apartment with my parents and husband, my nephew was seated on my lap. We were playing. I was wobbling him on my lap and pretended to \"eat\" his little arms. As I was talking  gibberish, I unintentionally slipped into the \"sad beige baby\" persona. I genuinely didn't anticipate it becoming an issue.However, when I mentioned \"sad beige baby,\" my sister became furious. She expressed frustration, stating she's tired of people critiquing her decorating preferences. When my brother tried to explain that it was meant as a joke and that she is \"too anal\" about her anesthetic, she angrily spilled her red wine on the white tablecloth, exclaiming, \"Are you happy now?\" She then asked us to leave and has since inundated me with direct messages on Instagram, sending me  numerous mommy accounts sharing the same aesthetic.My mother believes I should apologize for my unintentionally rude comment. I'm utterly taken aback because, in truth, it wasn't even directed at my sister. My nephew happened to be wearing a beige sweater and made an exaggerated sad face, which prompted laughter, thus me calling him a \"sad beige baby\"",

He�s been with his fianc�e (DIL) since they were 20 and he wants to marry her.I�d always liked her before now, she�s a smart girl, she fits in well with the family, she�s driven, and she makes my son happy. Everything was all roses until they got engaged.Now since I was little I was fascinated with jewellery. When I was older and married and had my own income I started to collect rings.I would �design� them myself, used to ask friends and family to give me cash I could put towards them, and save up my disposable income towards whatever ring I wanted.Edit 2: Okay apparently this above paragraph is controversial. It is the custom of my family since always to give cash in celebrations. It�s also very normal in my community to ask your friends to give cash - I have done this myself for my friends.HOWEVER THE MAJORITY OF THE COST OF EACH PIECE OF JEWELLERY WAS ALWAYS BORNE BY ME. Whatever I got from birthdays was a bonus top up - not something I relied on to be able to afford it.It would be less than 10% of each piece definitely not the bulk. 10% being the highest but mostly it was around the 3-4% mark if any.Sorry but quite a few comments are being derailed by thisI wasn�t buying one every year but over time I have a nice collection of rings. My favourite are a sapphire with a halo of diamonds, an emerald in a trilogy with 1ct diamonds either side, and a Ruby set in a pav� band.After son got engaged and we invited him and DIL to dinner at home, DIL asked to speak to me. She said she�s been seeing my emerald ring over the years and she has always wanted one.She pointed out that I wear it least often, which is true, and demanded that I gift it to her as an heirloom engagement ring. This is in addition to other wedding gifts and expenses we had discussed as a family during dinner. This includes gold to the value of approximately �6000 which is honestly more than my entire wedding cost, and which I still think is a significant amount.This rubbed me the wrong way and I admit I accused her of trying to pick through my estate before I�m even dead. I told her the ring is mine and I can even sell it on my deathbed if I want to; she has no right to expect it and she�s being a rude brat by demanding it.She yelled at me that something like this can�t just be sold, it should be an heirloom and it�s normal for heirlooms to Be passed on while the wearer is still alive.I told her to leave if she was just in my home to demand my property and she stormed out, taking my son with her.She�s mad at me and son says I should�ve just passed the ring to her since I have others and it would Be a nice gesture to welcome her to the family! He says it�s no different than his sister occasionally borrowing some of my pieces.My husband and my daughter are on my side but this is the first time my son has shut me out like this so AITA?(Edit: DIL has an engagement ring already. It�s beautiful and I would call it expensive. This is not a case of her being proposed to without a ring.)",

It was held at me and my boyfriend's new house, the first family event we've had here. My boyfriend really wanted to take part in the gift giving so went all out with gifts, spending an average of 100 dollars per person. He was so excited to give everyone their presents since we spent not only money but also a lot of time picking everything for everyone.The festivities were a hit and my boyfriend and I stepped away for a bit to have some quiet time together, while we were resting on the stairs, we overheard my cousin [17F] chatting with my niece [15F], they were joking around about a few family members and mentioned my boyfriend and how he was \"too gay to function\". Honestly we didn't mind it too much, it's a movie reference and they're kids, but then another cousin [24M] came in and began making harsher jokes, which the kids laughed at. These \"jokes\" brought my boyfriend to tears and I refused to let that slide.When the gift trading began, I took the three aside and let them know that I wasn't happy with their comments and that they weren't ok to say. I told them to apologise to my boyfriend because it was unfair to him and they refused because they were just jokes that we weren't meant to hear. I told them I didn't care and they had to apologise. They refused again and I told them that since they don't respect him they don't deserve the presents we got for them. This got them to backtrack and say they'd apologise but I told them it was too late but they should still apologise. This is where I think I might have been too harsh.The youngest of my cousin's told her mum, my aunt, that I was refusing to give her and the other two their presents and she was angry about it, she told the parents of my niece and the male cousin's dad and partner about it and all of them made a huge fuss. Me and my sister kicked them out and when they tried to grab their presents before leaving I stopped them and rushed them out the door. The whole thing fell apart after that and it all ended very abruptly.So, aita for kicking them out and taking away their gifts over jokes?",

As it was, my husband and Spencer didn�t have a very brotherly relationship given the 30 year age gap. He already was more of an uncle. 6 months ago, Spencer�s mom lost her parental rights.

He�s been calling us mama and daddy for a little over a year now, so this is just basically all legal, not changing how we feel in our hearts.Charlie and Mike have been supportive of the whole ordeal for the most part, but we�ve faced a road bump recently. When Spencer began calling us mama and daddy, Charlie found it odd. He said that we weren�t his parents. I said legally, yes we are. I said he doesn�t have to be �Uncle Charlie� if he doesn�t want to be, but we are raising him. Charlie says that we�re basically erasing their dad from Spencer�s life. I said no, we talk about him AND Spencer�s bio mom often. This won�t be a secret. As it is, Spencer is very smart and is aware that he only came to live with us 2 years ago. Mike and my husband have both told Charlie to let it go.I�ve noticed, however, that when talking to Spencer, he refers to me and my husband by our first names.

Spencer is confused because he knows my husband is his brother but he doesn�t look at him like that. We�ve tried talking to him about it but Charlie claimed �it�s force of habit�.We were trying to let it go but then one day, Charlie corrected Spencer when he called me �mama� and said �no, that�s Kate�. Spencer got confused and said �no, that�s mama!� Charlie told him that I�m not his mother. This only upset Spencer further.I�ve had enough, frankly. Spencer is our son. We have him in therapy and have also asked Charlie and Mike to attend family therapy with us. Only Mike has agreed. I told my husband that I don�t want Charlie at Christmas (we�re hosting) if he�s just going to upset Spencer and undermine our place as his parents. My husband said it�s completely up to me.

My wife (36F) and I have 3 kids (10, 8, & 5) so we don't get out of the house for dates very often.  The holiday party was planned almost 2 months ago and my wife agreed to attend with me.  I suggested we make it more of a \"date\" by either going out for drinks after the party or catching a late-night movie.  She thought this was a good idea too. I also arranged for a babysitter to come watch the kids for that night.The day of the party, my wife got home from work and told me that she had a horrible day and was in a bad space mentally so she didn't want to come to the party.  I told her I was disappointed, but I understand if she wants to stay home.  As I was getting myself ready to head to the party, I called the babysitter and cancelled.  I apologized to her and offered to Venmo her an hours worth of our agreed rate ($30) to compensate for the cancellation and she agreed that was reasonable.As I was getting ready to leave, my wife asked when the babysitter was going to come.  I kind of looked at her funny and told her I had just cancelled the babysitter because she was no longer coming with me.  She got mad at me and told me that I knew she had a bad day and was in a bad mental state and needed some time to herself.  I told her that I had assumed none of that meant she was incapable of watching our kids and that I didn't think having the babysitter come when my wife was still home made any sense at all.She told me to call her back and see if she could still come watch the kids and I told her that if she wanted to do that she can do it, but I'm not going to.  She tried to argue with me about it, but I told her that I had to leave for the party.  While I was at the party, she sent me multiple texts about how the kids were driving her nuts and that the babysitter didn't answer her calls and she needed me to come home.She kept blowing up my phone and I eventually left the party over an hour early to go home.  When I got there, she kept arguing with me about how I was an AH for cancelling the babysitter when I knew she had a rough day. I told her I was not going to pay a babysitter just so that my wife can rest after a bad day.  I told her she could have just thrown a movie on for the kids and relaxed.  I told her she was the one who ruined our potential night out and that having a bad day at work is not a good enough reason to pay a babysitter $150-200.She still thinks I was an AH for cancelling the babysitter without talking to her first and she's still mad at me for it.  But I don't think that was an unreasonable assumption to make considering that there have been plenty of times when I've had a bad day and I am still 100% capable of watching the kids by myself while my wife leaves the house.EDIT:  Hey everyone, can we cool it with the purely speculative cheating angle?  My wife goes to yoga class with 5 other moms from our neighborhood.  So, unless they are all stepping out on their husbands or all in cahoots together, she's not cheating.  Our neighborhood isn't a reality TV show and real life isn't like that.  She's an introvert and when she gets to her social limit, she doesn't want to go out.

I told them I could get into the climbing gym on a good deal and he asked how much weight the harnesses and rope could hold. I looked it up and it's over 2000 pounds. He also asked how it was trust based and I explained about belaying and climbing and trusting your belay partner will catch you when you fall.I have only met my brother's wife once due to him moving across the country, she was an average weight when I met her, however, I didn't know that over the course of 3.5 years, she had gained over 300 pounds and my brother didn't mention that exercise might be an issue.I didn't comment about her weight when we met up at the gym, just said hello, paid for our time and their rentals and went in toward the more difficult bouldering section. After about 25 minutes my brother came over to me and told me they were leaving and we would meet at home. I told him ok and kept working on my bouldering until my two hours was up.After I came back to my parent's house, my SIL cornered me and screamed at me, talking about how I set her up to make her look and feel fat and how I rub my athleticism in her face. I apologized, but she and my brother got a hotel room, and both of them refused to speak to me. So AITA?",

	"body" : "TL;DR: I cried and walked out of my SIL's birthday lunch because she'd encouraged her kids to steal and hide my glasses.Longer version: my husband and I (38F) went to my SIL's house for her birthday. It's quite a long drive and so we drove up the day before and stayed overnight in their spare room (the birthday meal was going to be midday). She has two kids aged 4 and 7. Husband and I went in separate cars as we were coming from different work places to get there.I am very short-sighted and literally can't see 1ft in front of my face without my glasses. Every night I take them off and put them on the nightstand right where I know I can reach them in the morning. now, apparently, SIL thought it would be a funny prank to get her kids to sneak into the room (I sleep with earplugs in because husband is a loud snorer) and take and hide my glasses.In the morning of her birthday, I couldn't find my glasses on the nightstand. I had to ask husband to help (in case they had fallen off and under the bed or something) but we couldn't find them anywhere. I was really distraught because as I said, I'm literally almost non-functional without them. Husband helped me down to breakfast and I explained that I wouldn't be able to take part in the meal midday (nearby restaurant) and couldn't drive myself home. I was really upset. They are also expensive glasses because I have to get the lenses thinned etc. so about �600.SIL let this go on until they were literally about to go for her birthday lunch. I'd not been able to do much at all up until this point because *I CAN'T SEE* then she jokingly said to her kids, \"Ok, that's enough I think, go get them\" and the kids ran off to fetch my glasses from where they'd hidden them.She said not to blame them at all (I don't... ish) and it was her idea and just a bit of harmless fun.I put my glasses on, got in my car, said nothing at all and just drove home. My husband is on my side and has apologised on SIL's behalf saying that she thought I would see the funny side. He is very apologetic and offered to skip her birthday meal as well and come home. But HE is being apologetic. Not her.I've had nothing from SIL except from an angry Whatsapp message to the group (not directly to me but to the family group) saying that her birthday had been ruined because \"someone\" couldn't take a joke. Apparently after I left she had a meltdown about how the day was ruined because I drove off and the kids were upset.It is genuinely distressing for me to *not be able to see* but I see(!) how she might have thought this would be funny to get her kids to do. AITA?[edit] I feel bad that the kids think they are the reason I was upset or that they did something wrong.Edit to answer questions:Husband and I were travelling in different cars as we had set off from different locations and timingsWe went the night before so we wouldn't have to get up early and do the long drive first thingI'm not blind but the world is just a blur from about arms-length or less without glasses, so I can function, just not do anything useful and it's a PITAYes my husband looked for the glasses but I didn't do much in the morning because I just sort of sat and was bothered about how I'd go to the restaurant, how I'd get the car home etc. etc. I wasn't going to be of any use in actually looking for them, for obvious reasons. We looked in the obvious places (which, to be fair, was next to the bed because they're the last thing I take off before turning out the light and it would be fucking weird for them to be in the kitchen or somewhere because how would I have got upstairs? Anyway.)",

The thing that caused our family to keep her at arm�s length, was when she got mad at our mum for accommodating our younger sister�s autism and not force-feeding her as well as allowing her to read at the table (something that calms her down). She got on mum�s arse for �enabling an entitled brat�.Another example was when my mum supported Mark�s decision to get the tattoo he had been saving up for, for years. Jane proceeded to call mum up to complain that he made the deposit (with his hard earned, saved money) and had an appointment set. She told mum that was wasn�t going to allow this �emotional incest� anymore and that she�s happy to make an appointment for all of us for family therapy as this �enmeshment� is making her uncomfortable.She has continued to make comments like these, specifically to mum and it�s disgusting how little respect she has for pretty much everyone but herself. She�s not been invited to Christmas this year but Mark is. It�s unclear what they�re planning to do yet.A few days ago, Jane called me as mum had blocked her. She said she was 3 months pregnant and went on a long rant about the family dynamic. She then asked �why don�t you all like me?� I laughed out of pure shock and asked if she was serious. She didn't even respond, just said 'I'll call you when you're in the mood to be more mature.' and hung up.I told mum about the situation and she's on my side but Mark is fuming at me for laughing at Jane's question and angry at mum for being on my side. Mum just told him that he needs to talk to Jane about her constant comments and insults and she's expecting an apology.Mark won't talk to me and Jane blocked my number.AITA?EDIT: The tattoo has got nothing to do with our mum.

	"body" : "My late grandpa started his farm whilst he was in his early 20s. There were financial problems along the way, but it became successful, and he became rich. My late grandma who died last year grew up in the average working class home. My parents come from rich families and went to private schools and ivy colleges. My mother and father always wanted three kids; two girls and one boy. I'm the youngest out of three girls and my parents were desperately hoping their last child would be a boy but since I was a girl they were resentful to me and they didn't show any love to me and I was pretty much treated like Cinderella. Because my parents showed resentment towards me my sisters did too and I was bullied by them and they got away with it. We were treated differently as they both went to private schools, private colleges, they were also allowed to do whatever they wanted and eat whenever they wanted. I went to a public school, public college and I was only allowed to eat three meals a day. I don't mind going to a public school but I'm just trying to show how I was treated differently.At the weekends I was shipped of to my grandmother's so they could have family time. At age 12 I asked my grandmother if I could live with her and she agreed. As soon as she asked my parents they immediately said yes and started packing my bags. Whilst going to my grandmothers at the weekend she made me work on the farm even whilst living with her permanently she continued to make me work on the farm at weekends. I hated that I have to work on the farms and looking back now I realised why she made me do it as she made me work on the farm as a source of therapy as I was constantly arguing and her animals were my therapy. I remember spending most of my days sitting with the horses and feeding the chickens. I also spent a lot of time running across her fields.My grandmother sadly passed away last year and she left the whole estate to me which my family wasn't pleased about. I decided to leave my job as a lawyer and work full-time on the farm and I'm so much happier. When my grandmother was alive she also used part of her fields for wedding venues and events, she also allowed charities to have events on her farm free of charge.Two months ago my sister got in contact with me after four years of no contact and said she's engaged and asked me if she could use grandma's field as wedding venue as she would like to get married. The thing is I can't let go of the past and I have started therapy but I told her I need some time to think about it. My first thought was to charge my sister a price for the venue and make it a price she couldn't afford but it didn't feel right so I simply said no.Now she's passed my number on to my parents and my other sister and they're all saying this is my grandmother's farm and she should be allowed to get married on the farm and I should even do it for free.

He divorced his ex when Edith was 7, but she apparently had a hard time with the split, and moving houses, etc. He and I met and married when Edith was 10. Together, we now have \"Cecilee\" (15F) and \"Peter\" (10M).Edith has always been aloof with our children. She was never particularly interested in them, although both kids, Cecilee especially, would've loved a closer relationship with her. I did bring up to my husband a few times that I was worried about Edith not being closer to her siblings. He responded that her ambivalence was better than he expected, given how hard she took the divorce, and he did not want to rock the boat. I was not happy with this but I let it rest. He and Edith are pretty close, but she barely speaks to me, Cecilee or Peter.Cecilee has mostly gotten over her desire to be close to Edith. I used to see her perk up when she saw her at family functions a few years ago, making a point to sit close to her, or talk to her. She does not do that anymore, and is polite but not super eager when we see Edith now.So to the current situation- Cecilee recently discovered a tik tok account of Edith's cousin. Apparently Edith has her sleepover in her condo (she lives in a big, \"fun\" city), and they go to events. They seem to be very close. This opened up a whole lot of feelings for Cecilee and she got upset and responded to the video saying \"That's my sister. And she barely talks to me\".Literally, that's all she said. But she got quite a response with people giving opinions for both sides. Apparently, someone figured out Edith's instagram, and were sending her harassing messages. I definitely feel awful about that. However, I refused to reprimand or punish my daughter. She only said the truth. My husband is upset as Edith skipped thanksgiving at our place this year, and he thinks punishing Cecilee will help his and Edith's relationship.So AITA?",

Suffice to say, we didn't like either of them.When she was a child, she didn't understand why we didn't want to spend time together, and she would complain to our dad about us, and then he would punish us. This added to our hatred. Growing up, she was his precious child, and he would celebrate her birthdays and her milestones while ignoring ours. He always catered to her wants and desires, but never bothered to learn about ours. Any of her wrongdoings would be easily forgiven, but if my brother and I made any mistakes, like dropping the TV remote, he'd severely berate us. Despite belonging to a wealthy family, my brother and I struggled financially, and we couldn't even apply for scholarships.After all these and more, when we became mature enough, we moved away and had no contact with any of them. I thought that we'd never meet again, or so I thought. Unfortunately, the universe played me a fool, and I met her at my in-laws' family dinner. She was currently dating my husband's brother, and he brought her over to introduce her to his family for the first time. I was in disbelief, and I wanted to ignore her, but she saw me and happily had a reunion with me.

BIL came to the party, she didn't, but when we were going through the presents my son received, I saw a gift with her name on it. It was addressed as \"Aunt (blank) to (my son's name),\" and it made me feel uncomfortable. I told my husband that I'd return it, and I don't want anything from her in my son's life. He was reluctant but supported me. So I did.Later, when she received the returned package, she called me and asked me why, and I told her my reasons. She said that I was being immature by denying a gift meant for someone else. And she gave it to him as his uncle's fianc�e.While my husband agrees that I shouldn't have returned a gift given in goodwill, I haven't done anything wrong.
