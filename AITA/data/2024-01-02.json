	"body" : "I45f have a 27 year old daughter. She has 6 kids, between the ages 10-11 months. There are 3 different fathers, she receives child support from 2 of them, and she is still with the 3rd one and they have been for 5 years.  My daughter works part time, and her fianc� is a chef full time. They have lived with us for the past year and a half, due to getting evicted from their last home. The kids and them have our upstairs bedrooms (there�s 2) but that�s still crowded for 6 children. They are constantly asking me for help with phone bills, My husband and I have asked for no rent so they�d be able to save money to get a home, which I do not believe they were doing.I have put up with loud voices through out all hours, and waking up at different hours to cater to children, because I love my grandchildren. I never complained to my daughter because I believe family is very important. It�s just that my children are all grown up, my youngest moved out 4 years ago and my husband and I had hopes to remodel. We didn�t expect them to be living here this long.On Christmas Eve, my daughter gathered us all around and announced they were pregnant with baby #7. Everyone was all excited, but I felt dread. That would mean another child in our house with not much room. I looked over at my husband and could tell he felt the same, we discussed later and decided we were going to have to ask them to move out.Last night at dinner I brought it up to my daughter and her boyfriend and we told them, they have 2 months to find a place because we cannot have another child here. My daughter started crying, saying she couldn�t believe I�d throw her to the streets for having a baby, that this was completely unfair and not enough time. I told her I was sorry, it was painful for me as well, but these living conditioners were impossible. She demanded I give her more time or she�d go to the courts and I told her news flash, the courts only gives you 30 days. She then said my grandchildren were going to be homeless because I was selfish. She made a Facebook post asking for rooms to rent because �she�s pregnant and has nowhere to go and her family don�t give a sh*t about her.� AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for �ruining Christmas� and being upset the only gifts I got from my family were �joke gifts�",
	"body" : "Some background, my family likes to play pranks with Christmas and birthday gifts it�s nothing new. I (f21) as well as my 5 siblings (from 29 to 37 years old) have all been pranked on our birthdays and on Christmas and usually it�s one or two gifts. This Christmas though, I was the only person to get all joke gifts. For example, I unwrapped a MacBook from my brother, but when I opened it, it was just some chocolate (which I don�t eat so I gave it away) and the MacBook was actually given to my sister inside a bag she wanted. Another �gift� was what I thought was a book I put on my Christmas list was actually just the book cover put on a dictionary. When I asked my mom about the book she told me she gave it to my SilThis went on with each present my siblings or parents had given me. AirPods was just a charger block? Adapter? gift cards were used and had $0 balance, a card with Monopoly money, and so on totaling to about 12 joke gifts. I realized I went out of my way to get everyone something they wanted or they�d like didn�t get anything. At this point i was bummed so I went to the living room to watch tv with my boyfriend. At dinner they were all talking about how much they loved their gifts and when my dad asked why I hadn�t said anything about mine, I said there wasn�t much to say. Everyone but my boyfriend laughed and my mom said it was no big deal as everyone else also got some joke gifts. I told her every gift I got was a joke gifts and that the ones they got was also followed by the real one. My dad told me I needed to relax as I�m making a big deal about it and I�d have next Christmas to get the stuff on my list.Not wanting to go back and forth i told my boyfriend I wanted to leave and we can spend the rest of Christmas break with his family then go home. My family got mad and told me not to go and to just stay because it wasn�t serious. I left and put my phone on do not disturb during the drive and by the time we got to bf�s parent�s house, I had several missed calls and texts from them calling me names like ungrateful, sensitive, and childish. They said I ruined Christmas and made my parents upset cause I left. The next day, I exchanged and opened gifts with my boyfriend and his family and one of the gifts I had gotten was the book I wanted (the book my mom pretended to gift me). I posted it on my instagram story and not even 0 minutes after posting it, my sister sent a screenshot of my story to the family group chat and they basically got mad at me for leaving and telling me I ruined Christmas over some presents. They told me I owe everyone, especially my parents, an apology because my mom spent new years sad because of my actions. Now I just want an outside party to tell me if I�m TA here? Am I in the wrong for being upset about the gifts and for leaving? After reading their messages and sitting on this for a few days I�m now feeling like maybe I was upset over nothing and need to apologize to them.*Gonna edit as there may have been some misunderstanding, my Christmas list didn�t include expensive gifts nor was I upset I didn�t receive expensive gifts. I was merely upset because of being pranked with everything I got and being the only person who didn�t get a real present that is all. Another thing I�ll address is I dint do anything to my family which would warrant them doing this. The last �big argument� I had was with my sister which was over a year and a half ago. Thank you for the replies and I will try my best to reply to comments while I�m at work. Editing once more to add I participated in joke gifts when I was a kid, haven�t participated in the last 10+ years because I didn�t enjoy it or find if funny (which thy do know). I will reply with more info if needed when I�m on break or have time to reply. - and I am familiar with the term scapegoat but truthfully don�t fully understand so I will research that as well.",

	"title" : "AITA for the meltdown I had on Christmas day which caused my dad's wife to cry?",
	"body" : "The background starts with my mom dying. I (17F) was 11 and my sister's were 16 and 18. Our dad met his second wife a couple of years later (when I was 13). The expectations for my relationship with her and my sister's were very different. My sister's were expected to be civil but if they weren't close it was no big deal. But almost everyone (minus my sisters and minus my mom's family) expected me to see my dad's wife as some second mother or maternal/parental figure. They got married when I was 14.My dad's wife wanted me to divide Mother's Day between my sisters and maternal side with her. My sisters were not expected to do the same. But she would say she wanted to celebrate the day with her kid.She signed us up for mother/daughter things. She would get hurt when I didn't want to go and would never ask my sister's. I asked her before why she expected me to do these things with her but she never invited my sisters. She said she was raising me and wanted to be a mother presence in my life but they were grown. I told her (and my dad on separate occasions) that I didn't want or need and wouldn't accept someone else into that kind of figure. I was ignored.I had a small run in with my sisters when dad was getting married because I said he shouldn't and they said he should be allowed to move on and mom would want him happy. When I explained what was going on they realized why I was feeling that way. They tried talking to dad but it did no good.My dad's side of the family would all make comments that I was lucky to have another mother figure, or how I don't seem to give her the care and consideration she deserves. They would ask why I seemed to spend no time with her of my own free will. Or why I was never loving toward her.My dad told me I should show her more love and affection and he told me I made her feel left out when I didn't tell her stuff or when I made plans with others but not her.I know some people would love to have someone like this in their lives. But I want the same relationship my sisters have with her. But more is expected.So Christmas Day came and everyone was at our house for Christmas (minus my mom's family). My dad and his wife gave me a card \"from my parents\" and my sisters got them with \"dad and his wife\". Then when it became time for family photos we got one with the three of us and dad but then my grandparents wanted me in the family one with my dad and his wife but my sisters weren't expected to be in it. I tried to step out and my dad's wife said it wasn't a family photo without their kid.This was the point where I lost it and I told her I am not her kid, she is not my mother figure, that she is dad's wife just like she is to my sisters and I want it to be that way. I said I do not love her and hate how they all treat her like she suddenly became a parent to me. My sisters were on my side but my dad was furious and his wife cried and cried harder as I continued.AITA?",

	"body" : "I (27F) am in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some advice.I've been seeing this guy for a couple months, and we decided to go to a nice high-end restaurant for a date. Initially I was going to wear a nice dark blue dress that I like to wear out, but he asked me to wear a different white dress that I had shown him once as it matched his outfit (I�ve never had a guy ask me this). The white dress in question was a gift from my late grandmother and was quite expensive, so I was reluctant but agreed and just asked that we didn�t go anywhere after where I might spill something on it or otherwise mess it up (he mentioned clubbing after dinner which is why I said that, I didn�t want to risk messing the dress up) and he said we could just go to dinner and  I could change out of it before doing anything else. Great!However, the evening took a turn for the worse when he accidentally spilled his red wine all over my dress. He had gotten an unexpected call and when he tried to quickly mute his ringer, his elbow hit his glass and it spilled all in the lap area of my dress before I could react. It was completely drenched and stained. He was apologetic at the time, and I tried to be cool about it, but inside, I was devastated, especially since I had mentioned specifically how I wanted to be careful wearing it.Later, I mentioned to him that the dress was very expensive and asked if he'd be willing to help with the cost of cleaning or replacing it. To get it professionally cleaned and the stain removed would cost $100, which I asked him to pay half of. To my surprise, he got quite defensive. He argued that it was an accident and that I was being unreasonable for expecting him to pay for something like that, and that it was my fault for wearing it out knowing that it could�ve happened.I feel like it's a matter of principle. Yes, it was an accident, but the dress is ruined, and it was extremely sentimental to me not to mention a valuable dress. He thinks I'm being materialistic and making a big deal out of nothing. Now, I'm not sure how to feel about his reaction. AITA for expecting him to cover the cost?",

Jasmin and I aren't that close but we're friendly to each other.She got pregnant a few months ago and she had her gender reveal party about 2 weeks ago. Everyone was so excited and happy when we found out she was having a girl.During this year's family Christmas dinner, she announced that she was going to name her kid Madelyn, but spelt differently of course! (as if that made it any better) Her daughter's name was going to be Madilyn. I was completely shocked. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect that Jasmin would want to name her kid Madelyn as well. If she told me before we named our daughter, I probably would've taken that into consideration before naming her.I asked Jasmin why she would want to name her daughter the same name as mine, and she said that technically it wasn't the same name since it was going to be spelt different. She also said that her great aunt's name was also Madilyn and that she thought that Madilyn was a cute name. Jasmin also mentioned that Madilyn was supposed to be the name of her kid before she had a miscarriage (this was before Madelyn was born). I never even knew that was what she wanted to name her kid because she never told anyone!I was really upset and told her she could've just told me before I named my daughter that she also wanted to name her daughter Madelyn. She said that I was always such a witch and that I probably would've named my daughter Madelyn either way. I don't even know what I ever did to this woman. I then asked what we were going to do about the confusion of them having the same name and she told me we could use my daughter's middle name! Like, what? I told her if anything, we should be calling her daughter by her middle name since my daughter came first.We went back and forth a few more times before I decided to leave early with my husband and Madelyn. My daughter was also pretty confused and asked why her aunt would want to name her daughter the same name as her. I'm still really upset and hopes she changes her mind, but this morning my BIL texted me and said that I should try to better understand Jasmin and her feelings. I texted him back and told him that she should stop being such a witch and try to understand my feelings instead. I really don't think I'm an asshole, but AITA?",

One of my friends commented underneath about how gorgeous my Christmas gift was as well.Long story short, word got back to my family and they totally blew up. Some were annoyed that I opened a private gift separately from the family. Others were criticizing the price of the gift. My siblings are now calling me disingenuous for harboring a secret gift, and they said that I did it because I think I'm better than them.I didn't open it with them because I didn't want their opinions, but now I'm starting to feel like an AH for keeping it a secret.

Joe's relationship with his ex-wife was hostile, possibly the most hostile I have ever witnessed even today. Joe's ex decided her and Joe's kids should never treat my mom with respect and she had them treating my mom like she was the other woman. I was upset for my mom at the time and she told me they would grow up and realize what their mom had done and they would come around, at least to the point of being civil.I think at some point my mom saw her stepkids as a challenge she needed to win. She went out of her way to win them over and there were many times it came at my expense. The worse they treated her the more she focused on them and forgot she had an actual son who loved and needed her. Joe was fine but he worked a lot so I felt abandoned by my mom and I felt like my mom wouldn't even notice if I was gone.When Joe's kids were teenagers their mom died and they moved in with us permanently. Before this they were at our house every other week. Them moving in was hell. They would yell insults at my mom on a daily basis, would tell her they wished she had died instead of their mom, they called a disgusting, repulsive whore who infected everyone she met. They spread a rumor around high school that mom had cheated on Joe and had infected him.Joe had his kids in therapy, he had talks with them, issued consequences for their mistreatment of my mom. But at no point did it stop and equally, at no point my mom gave up.When I moved out for college it became clear to me that mom was going to stay more concerned with her stepkids than with me. She was disinterested when I introduced her to my wife (we met in college). She really didn't take much of an interest in our wedding planning. She was busy trying to get Joe's kids to see her because once they moved out they told Joe they would only see him alone. Once or twice his kids asked my mom for money and that kept her holding on.When my wife and I had our first child is when I gave up. My mom showed zero interest and didn't make any effort to meet my daughter for weeks and when she did meet her there was still zero interest.Joe went to his kids for Christmas this year and left my mom home. Mom sent me a text saying this and I ignored it. Two days ago she left a voice message saying I should have invited her to my house for Christmas so she wasn't alone and could be with her son and grandchildren. I called her right back and told her she can't discard us and then expect me to invite her to Christmas. I told her she wanted to chase people who would rather see her dead and would dance on her grave than her son who loves her so she can fuck off and leave me alone and stop trying to make us her consolation prize.Mom claimed I was cruel and out of line with how I treated her.

It's a lot about him as a person and his views and stuff he says about people and somewhat about him not being so great about my dad after he and mom got married but I digress.My sister knows I don't really have much of a relationship with her dad. I do the bare minimum and if mom died tomorrow or they divorced tomorrow, I wouldn't remain in touch with him. He knows it. Mom knows it. My siblings at least pick up on it.I gave my son a name that honors not just my dad but my aunts and uncles and grandparents too. It's a name that connects to the family as a whole but gives him his own identity and is also a name we (my husband and myself) love.After my son was born my sister made some comments that I should have honored her dad in his name somehow. I told her that wasn't something we wanted to do but she could always do so in the future if she wanted. She did not let it drop. She mentioned it every time I saw her for the next month. When I did not give in and add a different middle name or change his name completely, she told me her dad was upset that we honored my dad and his side of the family but didn't honor him at all. I told her again she could always do it. I told my mom and her husband they needed to speak to my sister and tell her to stop mentioning it and I told him to stop letting my sister know he hates not being honored.They didn't listen and just before Christmas my sister came over to tell me yet again that her dad wanted to be honored in my son's name and hates that he wasn't and that he feels hurt. I told her I don't care what her dad wants. He's not my dad and I honored my dad and my paternal family and that's my right when my son is mine and my husband's child. I told her to honor her own dad when she has kids if she wants.She got really upset and told me I should care about what her dad wants because he has been my dad too since I was 8 and I shouldn't dismiss him so easily.AITA?",

Today I saw the dress and it is basically a wedding dress, big and white tulle with a detailed floral lace body.

	"body" : "My (f30) sister (26), Millie, has been in a string of bad relationships all her life. She dates unemployed losers, f*ck boy types who don't want anything serious, or men who are already in relationships. She becomes over attached to her partners and then gets heartbroken when these relationships don't end well for her, going so far as to play the victim when another woman called her out publicly for sleeping with her fianc�. Our family always pick up the pieces when her relationships end and she goes into massive depressive episodes. I love her, but it can be exhausting, and she never learns from her past mistakes.Her current partner (M26) falls into the unemployed loser category. He's barely worked in his life and spends most of his time playing video games.Despite this, Millie fell pregnant five months into the relationship. They moved in together shortly before the baby was born (he resisted moving out of his parents til the final hour) and they now share a nine month old son. They both love the baby, but the relationship is strained. Millie is on mat leave while he is still unemployed, and  furthermore, he doesn't help around the house with the baby or the chores, leading to Millie being stressed and overwhelmed. I try to help out when I can, but I am running my own business and also live an hour away, so the help I can offer is limited.Anyway, I got engaged to my long-time partner on Christmas Eve and announced the news the following day at Christmas dinner as the entire family was attending. Naturally, my family were ecstatic, but while Millie congratulated me, she looked sad/annoyed for the rest of the evening, and it became obvious her mood had soured.This resulted in the family coddling her all night and asking if she was ok, to which she kept on saying, \"I'm fine,\" while clearly being in a mood, refusing to engage in conversations, snapping at people, etc. At one point, she came back from the bathroom and looked as if she had been crying, so I pulled her aside to asked what was going on.She said the announcement of my engagement on Christmas was stealing her thunder, as it was her baby's first Christmas and her son should be the main focus.  She then accused me of \"rubbing my relationship and happiness in her face\" because I knew things were not good with her relationship.This is the part where I might be an ass. I got annoyed, called her entitled, and asked why she couldn't just be happy for me. She then accused me of not being supportive of her, and I snapped and said it's not my fault you let some loser knock you up; we all tried to warn you. I was also quick to snap because I feel like every family event since she got pregnant has centered around the same drama with her baby daddy.She ended up storming off and leaving with her baby and partner, and now my parents say I need to be the one to clear the air as the eldest sibling.",

	"body" : "Some background, we live on the east coast and his family lives in TX. My family lives about 4 hours away. They drive to us for every holiday, birthday, dance recital, etc. We have lived here for roughly 7 years (before that, we lived in TX). His family takes several trips/vacations a year and only once, this past year, came to visit us. Over the 7 years we have went to visit them at minimum 1-3 times per year. My husband works out of town about 3 weeks a month so it�s a lot of solo parenting for me.The weekend before xmas he went with his parents and siblings to OK to visit his grandparents. Myself and my children were unable to go as my daughter  had holiday things going on at home she didn�t want to miss. He came home the Monday before xmas and asked if we could swing a trip to TX after xmas to see his family and so his dad and him could go to the Alamo bowl. I told him that we unfortunately couldn�t. We really couldn�t swing an unplanned trip financially right now and with wanting to travel so close to the holidays booking prices were extremely high. I also explained to him that our daughter had off of school and all sports this week and that NEVER happens, especially when he is home too, and I really wanted this to be a week for us to all spend together. Especially since he will start traveling for work again on the 2nd of January and will not be home until the last week of January.The day before Christmas Eve I was out shopping and he texted me saying he knew I was going to be mad but his dad had booked him a flight and bought tickets for himself, my husband, my BIL and MIL to all go to the game. He would return the 30th. I got upset because we had already talked about going and I said that we just couldn�t swing it this year. His response was that he �knew nothing about this and his dad surprised him with it for a last minute Xmas gift� (which is a lie because they mailed our gifts to us and our children and he had received a Xmas gift). I asked him if everything had already been purchased as I would like him to not go. He said yes, and that he was going because it�s something he really wanted to do. We haven�t spoken much since then honestly because I feel very hurt that he doesn�t want to spend time with myself and our children before a long work trip, after he�s just seen his family last week, and would rather spend most of the week with his parents. He says that we could just book flights for myself and our kids to go but we honestly don�t have the money and I�m not maxing out a credit card for an unplanned trip.Tonight he asked me if I will be driving him to the airport tomorrow morning for a 6 am flight. I told him that he will need to book an Uber because I�m not waking our kids up at 3:30 am to drive an hour each way to the airport so that he can go on a trip that I don�t even want him going on. He says that I�m being unreasonable. AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for not attending my fianc�'s dad's funeral because I was uncomfortable with wearing a hijab?",
	"body" : "I [27F] have been with my fianc� [29M] for 4, almost 5 years now. He is a South Asian Muslim, but was born here in America, while I am White and Christian. He is not very religious, but I am fairly devout in my own faith. His family is also fairly religious and his mother and sister both wear hijab. We live on the west coast, but both of our families are on the east coast, but my family lives in the south and his family lives in the north so they are far away from each other. This is all relevant.The two of us flew out to visit my family for Christmas and New Year's. We flew in on the 22nd and the plan was to stay until the 2nd, when we'd be flying back home. His dad has been fairly sick for a while, and just a day after we arrived at my parent's house, he passed away. This was unexpected, since he'd been doing better recently. Obviously my fianc� was devastated and instantly booked us both flights so that we could attend his funeral together. We would've flown out on the 24th, so the flights were fairly expensive, booked last minute as well. Of course, I was sad to miss Christmas with my family and my parents were very disappointed, but I was happy to go to support him.However, a few hours before we were going to fly out, he informs me that I'll have to wear a hijab to enter the mosque for the service, and would not be allowed to go to the graveyard either. I did not feel comfortable doing this, so I told him I would rather not go. I figured if I couldn't attend the service, I might as well just stay with my parents so we could still do Christmas together, and he could come back to join us. This was a very hard decision for me to make, but my parents helped me a lot in making it.My fianc� seemed okay with the decision and left without me, although before he left he asked if I couldn't just come and not attend the service. He attended the service, but he hasn't come back, and told me on the 29th he'd be doing New Years there and hasn't messaged me since. His sister, who I've always been close with, texted me and told me how disappointed she was in me and that what I did was wrong. I don't think I did anything wrong since I couldn't attend the service anyway. She also said I should've at least paid him back for the flight that he got for me, but it was almost $1000, and I simply can't afford that. My fianc� makes almost 5 times as much as I do, and his family is also very wealthy, so I know the money is not an issue. My parents agree with me and said that it was important to spend Christmas with them, especially since it's the first after being engaged. They also think it was wrong of him to completely abandon me and our plans for New Years. My sister said I should've gone anyway to support him. AITA?Edit: I would just like to mention that my parents (and me as well) wanted him for New Years to show him their support since we are his family now too. Not to party or anything. And plus, his sister posted a picture of him, her, their other sister, and his childhood best friend all laughing together and captioned it \"making sure your brother brings in the new year with the three women who love him most\" (probably because she knew it would make me upset) so it's not like he couldn't have spent New Year's with us.Edit 2: I wasn't being selfish at all. I understood that his needs took priority, but I just don't think there was any point to going if I couldn't attend the service, especially since he was supposed to come right back and I could give him all the support he needed. If I had known he was going to stay longer, I would've flown out to see him. I'm respecting his needs by allowing him to have as much as space as he needs and allowing him to spend time with his best friend, despite the fact that he knows I don't like her. It's not like I'm unwilling to make sacrifices for him.Edit 3: My objections to wearing the hijab wasn't just strictly religious. I understand that it wouldn't make me any less Christian, but it just felt wrong and it made me feel uncomfortable to participate in something I don't believe in. Yes, his best friend did attend the service and yes she did wear a hijab as well even though she is White and Catholic. However, I understand that she was also very close with his dad since she knew him most of his life. I recognize now that I still should've traveled to be with him and his family, and that spending Christmas with my family wasn't as important. However, this was my first Christmas engaged, the first one without my grandfather, and my family was all really looking forward to celebrating this new chapter. My parents had also expressed concerns that we wouldn't be able to celebrate Christmas together since my fianc� doesn't celebrate it and they were afraid it wouldn't be as important for us, so it was sort of a sensitive issue for everyone. I was trying my best to keep the peace.",

The birth is supposed to be in March.In July, my brother and father are going on a three-week bike tour of some Nordic countries. His girlfriend will be left alone to care for the baby as well as the house, the vegetables, the garden, and all their animals (a flock of sheep and a dog). Her family lives abroad and while my brother's mother will be able to come by occasionally to help, she won't be able to stay the whole time as her health is poor and she's elderly. It should be noted that the girlfriend herself has a heart condition and a mid-risk pregnancy (the baby is fine).I recently overheard my brother and father talking together about the trip, with my brother saying that his girlfriend always knew that trip was in the cards since it was my brother's present to himself for his 40th birthday, and he \"told her so since they first met\". When I later tried talking to them separately about postponing the trip a year or so, that was the same reason I got. I pointed out that the baby wasn't planned and should take priority over a trip, but they both got defensive and said I was welcome to go help her if I cared so much. The problem is a) I work, b) I'll already be caring for my elderly grandmother while my father is away on said trip, and c) I can't stand babies and they know that.I called my brother selfish and immature. My father said I was being too judgmental as usual.ETA: The girlfriend is not fine with the trip. She's a first-time mom who knows nothing about babies and is very anxious about childbirth and childrearing, especially since she has no support system here. I don't know whether she and my brother had a conversation that prompted the one between my brother and father about the trip, but she's a traditional and selfless person who frequently does too much for others even when she suffers from it. That's also why I'm worried about her.ETA 2: Well, RIP my inbox. I read and appreciate everyone's feedback, though I can't answer all of you.
