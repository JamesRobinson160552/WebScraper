	"title" : "AITA for �fat shaming� my roommate because she wouldnt stop talking about how fat America is.",
	"body" : "I (25f) am an American who has been living in London for about six months now. My roommate B (23f) has been nice for the most part, and I�ve even come to enjoy her company. My only issue is that she is always taking jabs at America. To clarify, I don't think America is above criticism, and I have no problem shooting shit from time to time. When I first met her I would laugh along, and didn't feel any type of way about it. However, it�s become too frequent, and as time has gone on, I�ve started to notice an obnoxious air of superiority every time she does this, which really makes me feel like it�s not all in good fun anymore. She�ll even refuse to believe me if I correct her when she says something untrue (i.e., when she said, �Americans are all so stupid because all of your tests are multiple choice,� and I told her that wasn't true, she insisted the schools I went to must be different from most schools in America). I�ve tried to go along with it, as I don't want to be an overly sensitive person, but it�s starting to get on my nerves.All of my frustrations came to a head last night when she started talking about how disgusting it was that America is so fat (a topic I�ve heard her talk about many times). I was in a bad mood, I still tried my best to ignore her, but she just kept going. I�ve always had to bite my tongue when she talks about America�s obesity epidemic because B is overweight herself.  I finally snapped and stopped biting my tongue and said, �Don�t you think this is a little ironic?� she gave me a confused look and asked why she would think that, to which I replied �Well I�m an American, and I�m a lot thinner than you. This conversation would make more sense if you were the thin one.� She absolutely exploded and told me I had no right to make comments about her body. After that she locked herself up in her room, and now she refuses to talk to me. I made some beef stew for dinner tonight as a peace offering, but she still won't acknowledge my presence. I do feel bad about hurting her feelings, but I also feel like she shouldn't dish it if she can't take it.",

I was surprised getting a call today that I needed to pick her up since she got in trouble at school.Basically what happened was the class clown (Mia) was messing around in class was dancing/singing during class for no reason. My daughter had enough and told her to shut the fuck up, no one likes her and she is the reason no one enjoys school. A student recorded the whole thing. Mia ended up crying and principal office they were both sent.The principal wanted my daughter to give an apology to her. I told them no and that we are leaving. This started the mom telling me her daughter needs an apology. I told her that her kid is a brat and she should learn how to behave in class. That if she wasnt annoying as all hell my daughter wouldn�t have snapped after 5 months.She called me a jerk and my daughter is iffy if she should apologize so I am making this.Edit to clear stuff upThis was asked, the teacher was trying to get her back to her seat, this was in a middle of lesson. She was trying and Mia was ignoring her and kept goingAlso since some people are confused, this wasn�t a one time thing, according to my daughter she had 5 months of dealing with Mia and her behavior.Another question I�ve seen, does she have ADHD. No idea, not my kid. If she does it make explain some things but doesn�t excuse it.Update 1: so some stuff has happened since it posted this, it got out what my daughter did to the other parents and they have sent me email receipts of how many times they tried to get the school to do something about Mia. Most of the parents are pissed Ava had to go to the principals.The principal has sent an email about conduct in the classroom and a new policy that if kids disrupt a class they will be taking action. Don�t know what that means yet.",

I felt the question was invasive and personal so I responded, \"what's your pubic hair situation\", trying to give her a taste of her own medicine so that she would see how it feels to be asked an invasive question about your private area (and my question was less personal than hers - it was about a styling decision, which is done of your own volition and easily changeable, as opposed to something you had no say in and have no way to change) and hopefully realize she had overstepped the line, but instead she just blushed and ran out of the dorm room.Now my roommate is mad at me and wants me to apologize to her, but I don't think I did anything wrong here - if she doesn't like having me ask her questions about her private area, she shouldn't be asking me questions about mine.Was I in the wrong here?",

However, literally everyone I've spoken to is against me on this because \"it's just food, I would never make someone feel like shit over food, blah blah\". So, here I am.30f. I have a 13yo son named Colby with my ex husband. Last year my son desperately wanted to go to Japan because his father currently lives there and my son had been there multiple times for visits during the summer and fell in love with it. He begged me to let him live with his dad for a year and while it broke my fn heart and gave me extreme anxiety, I agreed. I couldn't say no. He went there for a year and came back home in August of this year. As many could imagine, Japan has much different cuisines than the US does and while my son wouldn't complain about anything I put in front of him, he did make a few comments about missing Japanese dishes. So I went through a few websites, got a hold of his dad, etc and I was able to get some of the ingredients and recipes shipped out to me. His favorite one is some type of noodles with a dark brown spicy sauce. I can't remember the name off the top of my head but since it's his favorite, I have his father send me out the noodles and sauce so my son can prepare it for himself at home, as well as buying him the fresh ingredients needed.Well, me and my husbands daughter (9) asked Colby the day before yesterday if she could have some of his noodles. He said no. He only said no because he's made the dish for her before and she wasted the entire thing because it was too spicy. So she doesn't like it and therefore he said no and reminded her that she didn't like it. Before my daughter could even respond, my husband pipes up with \"give her some, there's no reason why you can't share\". So I stepped in and said no, and that she's already had it and threw it in the trash and this is his food. He doesn't have to share his food. He just kind of walks off. Well, this morning my son asked where all of his noodles were (4 packages) and my husband says \"I ate them\". I asked why TF he would do that and he said \"because I wanted to\". To me this felt like a big \"fuck you\" because I told him my son didn't have to share his food, so I did lose it. He did this on purpose. I just know it. I told him he was a fucking pig on a power trip and he should be ashamed of himself for eating my son's food. He says I'm ridiculous and I'm an AH for calling him a pig (because he's overweight) simply because he was hungry and wanted to eat. Everyone else says I'm an AH too, as I said. AITA?",

	"body" : "My wife and I have a 6-month-old baby girl. Due to postpartum anxiety, which she is being treated for, my wife struggles with leaving our daughter with anyone outside myself or my mother, who lives with us. This hasn�t been an issue thus far and as I said, she�s in therapy so little by little, it�s been getting better.Unfortunately, my nephew (who was also 6 months old) passed away a few weeks ago. He had been in poor health since birth but it�s still obviously devastating for the entire family, especially my brother and SIL. They held the services the following weekend.I was in consistent contact with my brother and we were discussing the funeral. He said he knew it was a lot to ask, but could we please not bring our daughter. I said I completely understood and didn�t even intend to. One, in my opinion, babies do not belong at funerals. Two, this is a funeral for a baby of a similar age. Why would one want to bring up that reminder? My brother said he knows how my wife is about leaving the baby so they understand if she can�t come.Well, my wife became irritated when she found out I �didn�t defend her�. She reminded me that she doesn�t trust anyone to take care of the baby outside me and my mom, who obviously have to be at the funeral. She doesn�t want to miss it either, but also won�t agree to leave the baby with anyone else. We have several family members on her side that we are close to, as well as good friends who also have kids. I said even if she just went to the service and not the gathering afterward, that�d just be an hour. She said no, she can�t handle the thought of leaving her with anyone else. I said that�s understandable and that clearly, my brother and SIL would rather her not come if it means not having a baby at the funeral. She continued to complain.Finally, I said she has two choices and she needs to make one, I don�t care which it is. I won�t� hold it against her either way. One, either allow someone else to watch the baby for an hour. Two, stay home with the baby. She says that I�m not even pretending to be on her side and I said I�m not, because this isn�t even about us.My wife ended up staying home with the baby. When my mother and I returned later that afternoon, she shut us both out. Eventually, she calmed down but she has made comments here and there making it clear that she feels I should�ve tried to convince my brother to let the baby come. AITA?",

It is a fixer upper and I have been helping them out with the fixing.My father was a handyman and contractor so I have a lot of skills and experience with doing maintenance, repairs, and upgrades on a house. I also have pretty much all the tools I need to do most of the work.This last weekend I was helping paint the dining room. I had everything set up the way I wanted and I was ready to go. For some fucking reason his wife decides to let their dogs into the room I'm painting.One of them steps in the roller tray and then jumps up on me. His wife laughed it off like it was not a big deal that I had paw prints on me. I also had to throw out that primer because  it now had mud in it. I had told them both to let me do the work in peace.After I prepared a new tray of paint I wrote the word \"FUCK\" in huge letters on the wall. IN PRIMER.For those of you who may not know primer is the coat of paint that you put down before the actual paint. For lack of a better word it sticks to the wall better and when it dries it creates a better surface for the paint to stick to.His wife saw it and freaked. She said I was drawing profanity in her house. I told her it was primer and to stay out of my way.I then finished the job and went home. My friend called me and said that I had really upset his wife with my childishness and that she would not let me back until I apologized. I asked him what I was apologizing for. He said that I wrote a curse word on his wall. I asked him to provide a picture. He said he couldn't since I had painted over it. I asked what the problem was since the word wasn't there any more. He said that I needed to apologize. I said that him wanting me to apologize was in no way the same as me needing to apologize. He said that I could not come back until I did. No problem for me. I was helping him for free on my weeks off from work.He called me two days later and asked if I was coming to finish painting since I would be away at work for three weeks. I said I wasn't ready to apologize yet and maybe I would when I got back. I probably won't.Now she is telling everyone that I'm a shitty person for leaving a job half finished. I tell everyone who asks that I was working for free and that they told me not to come back.Now there is a big fight in our friend group between the people who think I should keep the peace and those who think she is being an entitled whiner. No one else is volunteering to help at their house and now either they have to half ass the job or pay someone. I'm getting hell for that too.AITA?",

My wife Emily and I had attempted to convince her (although it was mostly I who did), but it had not worked so we gave it up.We had planned to have lunch at a restaurant and we took the car. Ethan wanted to sit in front, but Rachel told him \"Sorry, but only proper members of the family get to sit in front, and you're not really their child.\"He was shocked, and I asked her to take back what she had said, but my wife asked me to not start an argument as it was her birthday. Ethan did sit back with Emily in the back, and so I did not argue.We went to the restaurant, and she wanted an expensive dish. I ordered it, and Ethan said that he wants the same stuff. But Rachel did not like that, she said:\"You want an expensive dish when he's not even your Dad in reality? I'd have thought you'd be more grateful as your parents are dead and you're adopted now.\"I asked her to apologize immediately as I could see that it had really hurt him, but she just shrugged and said, \"Well, if you want to have it, go ahead. I don't care anyway.\" But I told her \"You are going to care because your birthday's cancelled, we're headed back.\" I asked them to head back to the car and she yelled at me and said she was just joking, that I cannot do that, etc.We had a really huge argument but in the end I got back them back to the car.

Before living together we had a good relationship, the problem came when his wife wouldn�t follow the home rules.They are pretty simple like clean up after  yourself, don�t be loud at night and the big one was no drinking in the home. No alcohol in the home. We made this really clear and my son knows his mother has trauma related to alcohol. We informed DIL in general terms also.The first few month seemed fine and it turned for the worse when the weather got cold. We couldn�t prove it at the time but we were sure they were drinking.

Apparently it was a 300 dollar bottle and it cause a huge fight between her and DIL.We let them stay until the renovations were done and they have been out two weeks ago. Relationship has been tense and I figured we just need time apart. My son met up with me and told us we can�t see our grandkids anymore. That the incident made him rethink our relationship.I told him that was bullshit, the he knew the one big rule in the home, caused stress to his mother ( my wife). He told me it was final and I told him if he goes through with this he will be out of the will.This started another argument and he is pissed at me.Edit: the wine was open.Edit 2: I called my sister, and asked her to tell me to track down the price of the wine. My wife sent a picture of the bottle when this happened.You were right, it wasn�t 300 but around 25. I need to talk to my son and find out why she lied about that.Edit: long night, I had a conversation after I sent a text sayin that the bottle was only 25. During the argument when that price came out DIL thought my wife poured out all the wine, there was a case up there worth 300.

	"title" : "AITA for brushing my daughter�s friend�s extremely matted hair out so she avoid a drastic cut?",
	"body" : "My daughter has a friend, A (13F), who has been going through some health issues that I don�t want to put here. A�s mum passed away when she was little so it�s just her and her dad. Since he has started dating his girlfriend (we�ll call her C) A�s needs have been pushed to the side a little and he�s just not noticed that A has been struggling. She�s doing better now after getting the help she needed.However, A�s hair has been extremely matted as it had not been brushed for months. A had been hiding her hair under hats and hoods at home and trying to disguise it at school in buns. She stayed over at the weekend and I only found out about her hair when they came downstairs after getting a comb stuck in A�s hair trying to fix it. I comforted A as she was ashamed about her hair but had hoped that she and my daughter could fix it. My daughter convinced her to tell me about it as she had been scared to say anything to anyone as she thought she would be judged as her dad�s girlfriend has made comments about her appearance when she was going through her health issues. When A was going through her issues, I made it clear to her and my daughter that our home is a judgement free zone and if she ever wanted to come to me or my husband for help then she would get it. A then asked for help detangling her hair. So that�s what I did. We put on some films and worked on detangling A�s hair. It took hours, but it was doable.When A went home on Sunday, her hair was completely detangled and neatly braided into two dutch braids. She was happy and thanked me for helping with her hair. Then Monday I got an angry phone call from C because she was meant to be taking A to get her hair cut due to how matted her hair was. Apparently C and A�s dad had noticed how bad it was and C had told me that she would get it sorted. C is mad because the salon they were going to had charged her a cancellation fee for cancelling the day of the appointment. C wants me to pay her back for the cancellation fee as it�s my fault for fixing A�s hair when they were going to get it cut out. I told her that I wouldn�t be paying it, I just did the right thing by A instead of going to the extreme option straight away. C then said that A was no longer allowed to be friends with my daughter and they would sue me for the cancellation fee. It was �60 (half the cost of the cut).My daughter told me that A knew about C wanting to cut her hair and A didn�t want the hair cut which is why she went to my daughter for help. A like my own daughters has long hair, so cutting the matted hair out would have meant her losing well over half of the length of her hair.AITA for brushing out A�s hair so she avoided getting a drastic cut.Update: This got more attention than I thought it would. I would just like to clarify a couple things. 1. While I am not going to go fully into A's health issues, the matted hair is the result of a depressive episode. Once things got better, she was just very embarrassed by the state her hair was in but didn't know how to fix it. So she hid it and it got worse. She is able to brush and wash her hair when she's ok. 2. A isn't being neglected by her dad. He knows he hasn't been the best dad to A and is trying to be better when it comes to her. Since A's health issues, he has been seeking help. I'm not going to report a man who I can see is trying to get better as a parent.A's dad (I'll call him J) came round earlier as he wanted to talk to me. A and C had gotten into a shouting match yesterday because of the cancelled appointment. C had told A that she wasn't allowed to see my daughter anymore until I paid the money I owed - this was news to J - and A told C that she was going to continue seeing her friend. A also told C that she hated her and that if anyone was going to take the place of her mum it would be me because I care about A as a person not just her appearance. J wanted to know what had happened with A and why I owed C money. I explained it all to J and he was horrified to learn that C was going to cut A's hair short instead of helping her. He had been under the impression that the appointment had been to get her hair detangled and wouldn't have consented to A getting a big chop. He hadn't realised how focused C had become on A's appearance with her hair. He told me that he wasn't going to stop A coming around as he knows how important my family is to her. When her mum died and he fell apart, we provided the stability they both needed. I told J that A is always welcomed here and she knows it, but it's her dad that she needs. She needs him to be there for her and to support her through whatever she is going through, having her dad will mean more to her than having me there. J agreed with this, and that he knows he's not been the dad that she needs and is going to try and be better for her. He's asked if I could recommend a family therapist who could help them, and I gave him a few names. Since A started going through her issues, J has stepped up. He's not the same dad that he was when they started but he does still have a way to go to be dad of the year.Since speaking with J I've had angry texts from C, furious that I 'went behind her back' and spoke with J when she was dealing with the issue. In the string of angry texts she sent me, she said horrible things about myself, A and my daughter. I'm not engaging with her anymore, she's a walking red flag. I screenshotted them before blocking C and sent them to J's work phone (J gave me his work number when he started dating C because she had been screening and deleting messages before he saw them. She doesn't have access to his work phone.)  My daughter has been messaging A making sure she is ok, and she will be coming to stay at the weekend as she doesn't want to be at home when C collects her stuff. I'm not sure what is going on with that relationship, nor do I want to know but it does sound like J is finally putting A first.",

We have educations and careers. We have stable relationships. We are reasonably well behaved adults and our kids are a pretty good bunch.My sister just never grew up. She hated rules. She hated that my parents got her to watch me when I was young. She moved out when she was 18, took her education savings account and spent it traveling around.I was going to host Thanksgiving this year and my mom mentioned that my sister and her family would be in town. They have not visited for four years. She asked me to include them. HARD NO. I said that wasn't going to happen. So my mom said she wanted her whole family together so her and my dad would host.Well she just called me. A bunch of stuff is missing from her house. Jewelry, sports memorabilia, knick knacks. Stuff that would be easy to sell on eBay. Or pawn.I snorted and asked her if she remembered why I do not allow my sister in my house. She said that when I allowed her to stay with me she stole cash from me and her kids stole my stepson's video game.I asked her why she thought they wouldn't steal from her. She said that I'm being cruel to rub it in when all she wanted was family time.",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my sister it�s her own fault her family is a mess because she wanted to adopt?",
	"body" : "My sister �Lucy� (38) has always wanted a big family. She and her husband �Tom� (40), had their son �Logan� (now 9), but due to complications Lucy couldn�t have more kids. Lucy was devastated. About three years ago, she and Tom decided to adopt. Tom never outright said he didn't want to go through with it, but it was clear to see he didn�t care one way or the other and just wanted Lucy happy. Logan said he didn�t want a sibling. Lucy brushed over all these concerns with the �they�ll get on board eventually� attitude.Long story short, they were eventually matched with boy, �Jack�, who is now 11. Lucy said they all bonded, but Jack had behavioural issues and whenever I saw them, I picked up on the fact that over time Tom seemed to be getting less and less keen, and many times when it was just adults he commented on his worry that Jack had latent issues because of his traumatic past. Lucy adored Jack and rubbished these concerns. I brought up Tom�s hesitation but Lucy said it was just taking longer for him to bond.They officially adopted Jack about a year ago, and since then things have fallen apart. Jack�s behaviour has either got a lot worse or Lucy wasn�t speaking about it as much before, but it�s clear Tom is at his wit�s end. According to Lucy he works late constantly and whenever Jack has a tantrum he helps Lucy calm him down, and then takes Logan and leaves the house. Logan now hates Jack and won�t play with him which causes more issues, and he�s started to act out. He spent his last school holiday with my family and is set to spend Christmas with us again because even the family therapist says it�s good for him to have some space.Having seen this all unfold has been heartbreaking. Tom and Logan look more miserable every time I see them and though Lucy would never admit it, she does too. Whenever I speak to her she talks about how hard it is but always has Tom and Logan at fault. She has never taken any accountability for the fact that she didn�t listen to anyone�s concerns.She called me a couple of days ago to discuss plans for Christmas and when Tom would be dropping Logan off at my home. She again started ranting about Tom has basically shut down at home with her and Jack and how she thinks he�s going to leave. She was calling him every name in the book and then started saying she was disappointed that Logan doesn�t love Jack and she can�t believe she raised a bully. I lost it. I told her the really bully was her, she bullied her family into adoption as a form of wish fulfilment and Tom shouldn�t have indulged her but most of the blame falls on her for destroying her family. She screamed and cried and eventually called me evil and hung up.My parents are now saying I was an AH for telling her that even though we all think it, but I think she needed to hear it, and stop blaming her own child for being unhappy living in the chaos she created.Edit - for everyone saying I said or implied that Tom is blameless, I didn�t. I said to Lucy that Tom shares the blame, but I do think most of it lies with her. Who I don�t think has any blame, no matter how she�s tried to place it on him, is Logan.",

He got in trouble at school for a week with after school detention and he got grounded at home and a long conversation.I also thrown out that if she wanted I would be fine with him moving classes. So he moved classes and they don�t interact at all. You would think problem solved but no. I kept getting messages from the mother, my son has class 8 hours in another room and the school has told me both kids are not interacting. I have confirmed this with both teachers, they aren�t even in the same lunch period.It�s his birthday this weekend and I sent out invites to his friends, I got a call this morning about why her daughter wasn�t invited. That she is unsure now and should be invited.That I need to make this right. I had enough and told her my son doesn�t own her kid anything  and if she can�t handle two weeks of being called a suck up then she needs therapy.She called me a jerk and I need an outside opinion.I know my son messed up but seriously they haven�t interacted in a few months since this happened at the beginning of the year.",

I�m a little disappointed she won�t stand up to them but I also don�t blame her for not wanting to get involved.It was bad today and my brother called me ranting that my daughter should stand up for him.

He is overweight and perhaps cannot see his equipment and the toilet so when he stands to urinate it goes everywhere. Not great. But it would be better if he at least cleaned up after himself. Instead he leaves urine all over the seat, tank, and floor. At his house my sister probably cleans up after him. I don't know and I don't want to know.I was having a similar problem with my son until I had his father teach him how to stand to pee. And to clean up afterwards.  My son still sits most of the time though. And if he does sprinkle a little he cleans up.I went to use the washroom after my brother-in-law came out and it was disgusting. I've talked to him and my sister about it before and nothing has changed.Fine, new plan. I matched out of the bathroom and I told my son in a loud voice that he had to go clean his pee up since he sprayed everywhere and we have guests over. Exactly like I expected my son spoke up and said he hadn't used the bathroom and that it was his uncle who just came out.Everyone went quiet, my brother-in-law went red, and my sister went into the bathroom to clean. I apologized to my son for the mistake.Afterwards my sister said I was an asshole to embarrass her husband like that. I said that if an adult cannot piss properly or clean up after themselves perhaps they should be embarrassed.Now we are fighting and she says I owe them an apology.Two questionsDo I owe them an apology and am I the asshole?",

I'm a fifty-five year old woman and my son D [26m] and his wife J [30f] announced to me over thanksgiving that they are expecting their second child in six years. My husband  [65m] and I were ecstatic because J has endometriosis and having children is a struggle for her.  She has one 4yr old son Grayson with my son and he has a daughter from a failed relationship Sarah [6] they also have two adopted children Tim [8] and Gregory [7] who were foster kids that they were taking care of. For clarity: she was already a foster parent when they met because she thought she couldn't have kids and these boys have no family to reunite with.They are a happy family and they all love each other. My son is a businessman and making very good money and she is a hairdresser they live quite comfortably.  My daughter B. [28f] is a librarian and her husband K is a construction worker. Here's the problem. My son and his wife announce their pregnancy. J was crying and told me she was having a second son and they were going to name him \"Dustin.\" because it meant Thunderstone and lightning struck twice giving her two healthy boys. We were thrilled and my son cried.Then my daughter, B who always likes to be the center of attention, clears her throat and says, \"I'm pregnant too! Nine kids and counting!\" and I froze. My daughter for context is not well off although middle class and she is always hoping to get on TV, or some version or other, the \"Next Kate Gosselin\" she says. I congratulated my daughter who then cheered, \"three more and I'll be catching up to you mom!\" I laughed that off and asked my DIL if she needed anything; essentially or so my daughter and her husband K [30m] felt ignoring their happy news.  And I told her that while yes, I am happy for her, this was a huge moment for J and she could have told me privately. That she did not always have to be the focus of every family moment.B rolled her eyes and said that J having fertility issues did not make her baby any less important than her own. I agreed and told her that while that is true, J having struggled and suffered problems for years with her first husband including four miscarriages [not my son] did in fact make this quite an occasion. K rolled his eyes and said that she wasn't special for having a \"n-word baby,\"  [J is black] and I lost it. I made them both leave immediately while B called me an uncaring asshole and a terrible grandparent. My husband, son and DIL were on my side saying that it was their moment and I agree.

Claire has a daughter, �Ruby� (8f), who has additional needs (this will be relevant), and I have a daughter �Bea� (4).We are all, along with my mine and Charles�s parents, going to be on a family holiday over Christmas. Claire was originally not bringing Ruby as she was meant to be staying with her father but her dad is a flake and cancelled so Claire is now bringing her.For some context, Claire loves my daughter, which is great. She will volunteer to babysit her (I don�t need babysitting as I�m a SAHM and my mother is nearby for emergencies) unprompted, and whenever we see her at events she always wants to play with Bea. Bea loves her and it�s nice to see, but it is noticeable how she will spend a whole afternoon fussing over Bea even when me and my husband are perfectly capable of looking after her. But again, she�s great with Bea so we don�t mind.A couple of days ago Claire and I were texting about what to pack for the trip as I was lending her some clothes. During this, I sent her a picture of what I was packing for Bea to give her some idea of what Ruby would need, and Claire said she was really looking forward to seeing Bea. She then suggested for a couple of days during the holiday we do a �kid swap� where we babysit each other�s kids for the day. I was immediately not keen on this idea, as I have only met Ruby twice and I know nothing about her needs or how to properly look after her. Also, I come on holiday to spend time with my child, not farm her out to other people. I skirted around the issue, saying we could definitely do things together but Claire kept pushing me to agree. She wanted her and Charles to take Bea for a day to go ice skating. This back and forth went on for a while before I finally said no, I�m not letting you borrow my child, you already have one. Claire said I was being unfair and that she deserves a break and to have an enjoyable holiday, too. She then said she didn�t want to borrow my clothes anymore and stopped texting me.Charles is now saying she�s very hurt that I won�t let her take Bea out, and that Claire adores her. I said that�s not the point, I�m not comfortable caring for Ruby on my own and frankly I find it a bit odd that Claire�s idea of a break from parenting involves babysitting. Charles says I�m massively overdramatising and that babysitting Ruby for a few hours doesn�t need a degree and I should just help Claire out. Now I�m wondering if he�s right.AITA?",

We are not super rich for the city we live in but we are able to lead a comfortable lifestyle well within our means. Since we don't have kids yet, we are able to spend more on ourselves and each of us gets $500 of 'fun money' every month to do with as we please.My wife likes to use her money to buy clothes for herself or go out for brunches with her girlfriends. My hobbies are all over the place. I do something for a while but then bored of it quickly so I stop. I need something that gives me a 'thrill' so that I get that rush of dopamine. So, I decided to pick up gambling.There's a casino about 20 minutes on foot from where we live so every Saturday I go there to gamble $100. I only take the $100 and leave my wallet at home so that I'm not tempted to spend any of our joint money in case I lose. For the most part, I break even or lose some money. My wife hates that I gamble because she thinks I'll go down a \"destructive path\" but I honestly love it and do it anyway because that's what makes me happy, much to her annoyance.Anyway, a couple of weeks ago I got lucky and ended up making $1,000. I was obviously super delighted since I never won this much before in my life. I decided to buy a PS5 and a few games since I never owned a gaming console. When my wife found out I bought all this stuff, she asked me how I was able to spend so much since all of it cost around $700-800. I told her about my winnings. She got upset and said I should have given half of it to her.I told her I got this money from my share of the 'fun money' so it's my choice to do what I want with it. She said only the original $500 is mine. The $1000 is an income and should be shared between us. I disagreed because I don't claim 50% of her possessions when she goes out shopping. She called me selfish for only thinking about myself. She wants to go on a girls trip and this extra money would have helped her afford it. I told her what I do with my money is my business and if she wants more spending money, she can figure out a side hustle instead of using me like an ATM.She complained about me to her friends and they're all calling me a financial abuser for \"stealing\" what rightfully belongs to her.

I gently explained to him that he shouldn�t ever touch girls like that without getting their consent first. He didn�t know what consent meant so I had a mini discussion with him about how it�s not nice to touch people without their permission and asking first means that you know the other person doesn�t mind. My husband was silent during the entire conversation. My son didn�t seem to be bothered by our small talk (which only lasted a couple of minutes), replied with �okay� and then went to go play his switch. After he left the room my husband went off on me, saying that I�m making my son sound like a predator in the making, that it�s just innocent playground fun, and that I�m blowing it way out of proportion. I obviously don�t think my 5th grader is a predator, but I felt like it was important to teach him about the idea of consent from a young age.
