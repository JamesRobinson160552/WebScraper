	"title" : "AITA for �ruining Christmas� and being upset the only gifts I got from my family were �joke gifts�",
	"body" : "Some background, my family likes to play pranks with Christmas and birthday gifts it�s nothing new. I (f21) as well as my 5 siblings (from 29 to 37 years old) have all been pranked on our birthdays and on Christmas and usually it�s one or two gifts. This Christmas though, I was the only person to get all joke gifts. For example, I unwrapped a MacBook from my brother, but when I opened it, it was just some chocolate (which I don�t eat so I gave it away) and the MacBook was actually given to my sister inside a bag she wanted. Another �gift� was what I thought was a book I put on my Christmas list was actually just the book cover put on a dictionary. When I asked my mom about the book she told me she gave it to my SilThis went on with each present my siblings or parents had given me. AirPods was just a charger block? Adapter? gift cards were used and had $0 balance, a card with Monopoly money, and so on totaling to about 12 joke gifts. I realized I went out of my way to get everyone something they wanted or they�d like didn�t get anything. At this point i was bummed so I went to the living room to watch tv with my boyfriend. At dinner they were all talking about how much they loved their gifts and when my dad asked why I hadn�t said anything about mine, I said there wasn�t much to say. Everyone but my boyfriend laughed and my mom said it was no big deal as everyone else also got some joke gifts. I told her every gift I got was a joke gifts and that the ones they got was also followed by the real one. My dad told me I needed to relax as I�m making a big deal about it and I�d have next Christmas to get the stuff on my list.Not wanting to go back and forth i told my boyfriend I wanted to leave and we can spend the rest of Christmas break with his family then go home. My family got mad and told me not to go and to just stay because it wasn�t serious. I left and put my phone on do not disturb during the drive and by the time we got to bf�s parent�s house, I had several missed calls and texts from them calling me names like ungrateful, sensitive, and childish. They said I ruined Christmas and made my parents upset cause I left. The next day, I exchanged and opened gifts with my boyfriend and his family and one of the gifts I had gotten was the book I wanted (the book my mom pretended to gift me). I posted it on my instagram story and not even 0 minutes after posting it, my sister sent a screenshot of my story to the family group chat and they basically got mad at me for leaving and telling me I ruined Christmas over some presents. They told me I owe everyone, especially my parents, an apology because my mom spent new years sad because of my actions. Now I just want an outside party to tell me if I�m TA here? Am I in the wrong for being upset about the gifts and for leaving? After reading their messages and sitting on this for a few days I�m now feeling like maybe I was upset over nothing and need to apologize to them.*Gonna edit as there may have been some misunderstanding, my Christmas list didn�t include expensive gifts nor was I upset I didn�t receive expensive gifts. I was merely upset because of being pranked with everything I got and being the only person who didn�t get a real present that is all. Another thing I�ll address is I dint do anything to my family which would warrant them doing this. The last �big argument� I had was with my sister which was over a year and a half ago. Thank you for the replies and I will try my best to reply to comments while I�m at work. Editing once more to add I participated in joke gifts when I was a kid, haven�t participated in the last 10+ years because I didn�t enjoy it or find if funny (which thy do know). I will reply with more info if needed when I�m on break or have time to reply. - and I am familiar with the term scapegoat but truthfully don�t fully understand so I will research that as well.",

	"body" : "My sister 26 has been on and off out of the hospital. I am going to call my sister Anna. Anna got cancer when she was 15 and was able to beat it. Ever since she has been having growths and anytime one appears we are worried about the cancer coming back.My issue is that she always makes these announcements that she needs to go to the doctors again at the worst times. At the beginning I thought it was just bad timing but it has happened so many time when I hit a milestone. My graduations, my birthdays, my engagement party. Anytime she makes an announcement she needs to go back to the hospital my whole family with flock to her.I have had my birthday dinner turn into my relatives flocking to her for the whole night.I had a dinner party to announce my wedding  date for my relatives. It was going so great and it was a fun time until Anna told mom she needs to go back to the hospital. Soon everyone forgot about the reason for the dinner party and it was quiet. My aunt even stepped in to do a pray for Anna. Another event was taken over. I went low contact with her after that.She was invited to the wedding and it is in two weeks. I learned today she is in a on and off in a wheelchair from my mom/Anna. She will need to take it just in case for the wedding. I asked if the rest of the family was informed and she told me no. I told both of them they need to inform them. They told me they don�t want to worry them and won�t do that.I had enough and told them you need to tell before my wedding. Again a no. I then informed them Anna is not invited.This started a huge argument about how I�m a dick and my point is that I am sick of her stealing the spotlight. That what will happen if she rolls in with a wheelchair.Edit: I�m going to do a mass blast to all my relatives, saying she is in a wheelchair and unsure if she will be able to make it to my wedding, keep my sister in their thoughts and prayers.I�m gettin ahead of this.",

The issue is they always want to split the check. I have had the conversation so many times that I want to pay for what I ordered. It results in an argument where I have to bend or everyone is mad at me.I also make a lot more then my friends so it always result in them basically calling me cheap. They don�t get I want to pay for my meal and that is it.Anyways we went out to eat yesterday and they all ordered things that were around 30 dollars, I got the house salad and my total was around 12. They told the server to split the bill and I didn�t want to fight about it again.I asked the server to add on to the bill an entree and dessert for me to take home. This resulted in my bill going up into the 30s.So they asks me what I was doing, I told them I am getting more food, they got upset they I increased the price they needed to pay. This resulted in another argument and they think I am a jerk.Edit: Reddit I�ve done everything you have suggested, I have had the server take mine out and I pay for it, I have spoken to them. If I do anything that isn�t splitting the bill with them they get pissed",

	"body" : "My husband and I are expecting our first child. We moved to be closer to his family. I'm no contact with mine.My mother in law has been referring to the baby as \"her\" baby this entire time. She will say things like \"I can't wait for my baby to be born.\" \"My baby is going to be so loved.\" This rubs me the wrong way for reasons I cannot explain, but my husband tells me to ignore her.My MIL wanted to throw me a baby shower and invite her friends. She said they made an agreement a long time ago that they would celebrate each other's kids' weddings and births. My husband and I eloped and declined a reception for her friends since we don't know them. My MIL told me that I owed it to her to let her throw the baby shower since I hurt her friends' feelings by not having wedding reception. I asked if I could invite my friends, and she said no, that this was for her friends, and that if my friends wanted to throw me a shower they could. I reluctantly agreed.My husband and I spent hours on our registry, and my MIL asked for it so she could share with her friends. She said she forwarded the registry on. She asked me what design I wanted on my cake and cookies. I told her flowers because I am decorating the nursery in a garden theme.At the shower they provided me with a \"mother to be\" sash and my MIL a \"granny to be\" sash to wear. I noticed that the theme of the shower was circus animals. The cake had an elephant and balloons on it, and the cookies were animals. At first I thought that maybe the floral theme was just too difficult, so I rolled with it until it was time to open presents.Every present was some sort of circus animal. Onesies, blankets, toys - nothing on my registry. I was a little confused and even went so far to check my registry to make sure I hadn't goofed up and changed everything. I thanked everyone for their gifts and tried to sound as gracious as possible, but I was so confused.My husband, who is a little less tactful than I am, showed up at the end of the shower and noticed the theme right away. He goes \"what's up with all the circus animals?\" He looks at the presents and says, \"This isn't what we asked for.\" Then he looked at his mom and goes \"MOM. What did you do?\"She smiled and said, \"I didn't like the theme you chose for my baby. I'm going to decorate my baby's nursery at my house with circus animals, so I created a registry for myself.\" My husband said, \"YOU DID WHAT?\" She says, \"My baby is going to need a room at my house so I threw a shower for myself.\"I lost my composure and told her that she would not see MY baby and to stop calling the baby hers, and my husband told his mom that she's delusional if she thinks we're going to allow this. She started crying and said we are just withholding her baby from her.We've been getting texts from his family since the shower, calling us selfish and ungrateful and saying we ruined her joy of being a grandma.Are we the AH?",

Apparently they have a longstanding tradition where instead of drawing straws, they�ll throw all their underwear in a bin and then go act take turns wearing a blindfold and drawing a pair of underwear from the pile, and drawing the smallest pair of underwear correlates to drawing the smallest straw.I had never heard of this tradition, so I felt blindsided when right before Christmas dinner, my fianc�s mom yelled out that it was time to ��pull the straws�� to decide the order of who got to plate up their food first in case there wasn�t enough for everyone.At first I thought the family was joking when they announced this, so I laughed, which made my fianc� get real defensive. I volunteered to get my food last, so I wouldn�t have to participate, but my fianc� just got more annoyed and asked me to just try to be a bit more agreeable.The whole thing was just kind of weirding me out, so I called an Uber and went home.

Option two was I will buy everyone�s dress but what I chose the dress and my decision is final.My five bridesmaids voted and options two won. So I picked out a blue strapless dress with a mini slit. I really like it and I knew Mia would have an issue with it. I sent a picture to all the bridesmaid and confirming the right size before I ordered it.This is where it blew up.

Tom is a nice guy, and when she introduced him to the family, he and my husband hit it off, and my husband ended up hiring Tom to work for him.Tom and Ellen�s got married and had a baby, and during this time they started having problems. I didn�t hear this from Ellen, but from my dad, and from my husband, who was told by Tom. Tom then started staying really late at work and then progressed to coming over to our house often for drinks with my husband, and by extension, me. He became a regular visitor to our house, and began unloading his problems.This went on for about 8 months until one evening Tom was quite tipsy and admitted he�d developed �a crush� on me. Understandably, this meant he didn�t come back to our house (he has profusely apologised for this and we�re fine now, but obviously I just prefer some distance).I guess that whole thing was a wake up call for him because he and Ellen started going to counselling. During the counselling, he told her about what had happened, because Ellen called me and screamed at me for the whole situation. She said she and Tom would never be in the same room with me again after �what I�d done�. She made excuses for not coming to family gatherings I was at for a while before my dad confronted her and she said she and I had fallen out and weren�t speaking. I went along with this because I didn�t want to tell my dad the truth either. It has been over a year of this.But this all came to a head over my dad inviting both of us and our families to NYE and getting mad that Ellen wouldn�t come if I was going. He started ranting at me that we needed to grow up and make peace and if we didn�t want to talk to each other fine but not being able to be in the same room was nuts. I got sick of being berated and said I agree but it wasn�t me who started it. My dad then demanded to know what the fight was about and wouldn�t let up. Eventually I just told him.He�s furious. He called Ellen and yelled at her, he called my husband and yelled at him. He is seething that no one told him and that he has been acting like things are fine with Tom this whole time. Ellen is furious with me for telling Dad, saying I did this on purpose and have ruined things with Tom after she�d worked so hard to fix them.I feel bad for the results, but I also feel like carrying the burden of this rift that I didn�t cause was unfair on me in the first place.

After they got married Beth's pushiness got worse and Scott appears to have lost control.Beth was upset when she dropped my grandkids off one day that we had not added photos of her to our house and commented as such. In our living room we have a display with photos of our kids and their weddings. She felt her and Scott's wedding should be there.She was upset when my grandkids spent Mother's Day with us and our extended family and we did not include her. Scott wasn't invited either. Mother's Day is a difficult day for him due to a bad relationship with his own mother. But Beth said we should invite her too because she's part of the family and then she said she's one of our kids too. I asked her what she meant and she told me she is obviously going to be one of our kids now that she's the mother figure for our grandkids. I told Scott what she said and he was embarrassed and told me he would speak to her.Beth was also upset when my husband posted on Facebook to say something about our kids and she didn't get mentioned as one of our kids, but as Scott's wife (we mentioned Scott and how wonderful he was to Abby and how wonderful he is as a father).For my grandson's 14th birthday, we were all together and he wanted a \"mom's side\" photo. Beth attempted to get into the photo and when Scott tried to remind her she said she's part of the family now. He pulled her aside and the photo was taken without her. But she told one of my sons after that she felt like we weren't treating her as a daughter and then said Scott never treated her as a lesser wife.We saw them a little over Christmas and Beth was upset that we got them a joint gift (for her and Scott) instead of getting her one alone. She told me she's tired of feeling like she's not really family and she said she feels like we always put Abby first when she's here now. I saw red after this and I told her she can never take my daughter's place and the fact she ever thought she could is outrageous. She told me the kids call her mom and they think the world of her so why wouldn't we. I told her the kids have always called her Beth when I hear them and she turned around and said that's our fault because the kids should be calling her mom and they don't. She lost it from there. Beth stormed out and I explained what happened to Scott. He apologized and left the kids with us so he could speak to her.I think they worked it out but Beth said I was needlessly cruel to imply she's not as good as Abby and doesn't deserve to be our daughter.

	"body" : "I (39f) have three kids with my husband (46). Our two boys (13,12) and our girl (10).Before we became parents my husband and I were ,one and done, meaning we only wanted one child. And we wanted a girl. And if our first child would have been a girl, she would very very likely be an only child. However, I am beyond thankful that we had to try 3 times. I love my boys and wouldn�t trade them in for anything in the world. But the truth is that we only tried 3 times because the first one and the second one  weren�t girls.Yesterday my boys were picking on their little sister. Normally they adore her but yesterday they would not stop making fun of her. They said something like we should put her up for adoption because she is the last one. They were obviously joking but it upset their sister to the point where she had tears in her eyes. I told them to knock it off again and again but they continued. In the end I said that they should be thankful that their sister is the youngest one because I only wanted a girl and they would not be there if I had my daughter first. They looked at me in horror. My oldest one asked me if this is really true and I said yes. I know it was harsh and hurtful but they were bullies. My younger son started to sob and the older called me a b*tch. Then they ran to their room.When I told my husband what happened, he called me an absolute AH and nutjob for telling our sons the truth. When I begged him to help me to comfort them he told me to f*ck off and now he and my boys are not talking to me and the boys are ignoring their sister.AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for not letting our nanny leave for a date during our vacation?",
	"body" : "My wife and I had our first child last year and it's been quite an intense few months. My wife has been on an extended 'maternity leave' but on top of that we've also hired a nanny/maid to assist us with the baby as well as keep the house in order. She stays in our guest house. To celebrate our anniversary I planned for us to take a trip by ourselves just to reconnect and give her some proper time away from the our son. She was excited about leaving but was slightly concerned about leaving our son behind (her mother was going to come down and babysit with the nanny). Trying to ease things I asked the nanny if she'd be willing to come along with us on our trip and take care of the baby - stressing that this was supposed to be our couple vacation so most of the childcare will be hers and more than usual. She jumped at the idea and so I also arrange her ticket and accomodation (to be clear she was also paid extra for the 'overtime').The trip was a week long and our arrangement was going quite well at first. My wife was relaxed, we reconnected and our son was close by for whenever we missed him. We would take our son and give her a break either in the mornings or afternoons. On our last day she asked if we could take the night shift as she'd met someone who'd asked her on a date. Besides that going against our arrangement (the point was to give us a break from the sleepless nights), I'd already paid and planned an intimate date on the beach with my wife for our last night. It became a bit of an issue with her trying to guilt my wife and saying we were being unfair but by the end of it, we didn't give in and she looked after the kid. Upon returning my wife heard her on the phone saying that she was thinking of quiting over all of this and that we were blocking her future so here we are.Wife thinks we made a mistake, I don't disagree that it might've been assholish but ultimately it was our arrangement and she was paid extra for it. Are we the assholes?Edit: the post has been up for 12 hours at the time of writing this and this is the first time checking in since the first hour due to life but I just wanted to clarify some things I've seen come up.She got paid double her usual daily rate. Since she has consistent our daily we just refer to it as daily rate where she 'works' 8 hours. So we paid her for 16 hours of work daily.Our expectations were very clearly expressed to her and she agreed that it wouldn't be a problem. Depending on our plans, some times we took mornings and sometimes we took afternoons but on any given day it was one of the two. This was also preplanned since our trip had an itinerary. Each of these breaks averaged about 5 hours and that excludes the spontaneous breaks whenever we missed him and prepared him for bed.Also this assumption that my wife and I can't and don't take care of our child is silly. The nanny is there only to assist whenever my wife needs to nap/rest. My wife takes care of most of the childcare and I step in when I get back from work. Most of her [maids] work is housework. My wife is staying in home because of her traumatic birth which had complications she's still recovering from. She fully plans on returning to work when she's fit and our child is old enough.",

	"body" : "My brother (13m) and I (16m) lost our dad 10 years ago. Mom got married to Jared 6 years ago and after like a year my mom asked us if we would be okay with Jared adopting us and \"maybe changing your last names to his or adding his as a hyphenated last name\". I said no and my brother followed. My mom decided we should discuss it some more in family therapy and we went for a few months, then we had no therapy when stuff closed down, and then we returned when in office therapy was back on the table. Throughout the stay in place order my mom would ask us about our feelings and if we were more open to the idea.Recently my mom decided to try the divide and conquer way since the therapist mentioned that my brother said no because I was. She tried talking to my brother and he was adamant he would say no as long as I'm saying no.Mom then sat me down and asked me why I was saying no. She told me she had a few very practical reasons to want the adoption to happen, including protection for us if she were to die so we could stay with her husband. I asked her if that was because she knew I would want my extended family to fight for custody and to live with them but because she doesn't like them she wouldn't want that and knew my decision would carry some more weight unless I was adopted first. She denied it initially but then said yes. Then asked me why I was against the adoption. I told her I didn't want another legal dad and did not want the protection being adopted would offer.She then told me about my brother saying no because I'm saying no and she wanted me to agree so he would change his mind. I told her that won't happen and nothing she says will change my mind. She asked me to at least encourage him to be adopted and I told her I would not.I did speak to my brother anyway and he said he doesn't want to do it if I'm not and it would feel weird to him to be adopted by Jared when I'm not. He doesn't remember our dad so the attachment isn't a reason for him like it is for me. I told him I wouldn't be mad at him if he said yeah. He said he knew that but still.Mom and Jared sat me down and asked me again to say yes so he could adopt my brother and once again I said no. Mom started to cry and she got really angry with me. Jared said I was at the age where I could be mature and compromise on this. He told me I might not love him but surely I don't hate him so much that I would rather end up in foster care than in his care if mom died. He also said I am putting my brother at risk.AITA?",

I pay them in yuan and arrange the delivery over wechat so there is no tip and tax and they give me discounted prices.A week later she didn't have many groceries left and she asked me to add something for her and she will pay me back. I refused because she isn't part of the agreement and I don't want to betray the restaurant owners and also she wouldn't be able to pay me back in yuan.She seems upset and isn't being as cordial.aitaEdit: Ok the problem has been solved, i contacted two of the restaurants which are the ones i most frequently use and they told me it is fine to order for my roommate and she can order herself if she installs wechat. She doesnt want to use wechat so i have told her she can ask me.For those saying tax evasion etc, these restaurant owners are really kind people and often even give free meals at their restaurants to chinese international students who are struggling (sometimes others too not just chinese just that most customers are asian). I work now and am not a student anymore but they know that and said i can still use the services.This is a lot cheaper than uber eats and doordash but the only thing is you need to order only at lunch or dinner time.",

She called me her daughter, came over to see me all the time, called me randomly to just talk, told me she loves me all the time, etc. But after I got pregnant, something switched in her. She stopped calling. She never said \"I love you\" back when I said it. She only came over to see my husband and 9 times out of 10, it was trying to get him out of the house to go with her. Barely gives me a hello/goodbye in passing. She even tried staying in the labor and delivery room after she was already told no because \"her baby needs support\", and clung to my husbands arm- several times trying to get him to go sit on the couch with her instead of standing by me where he was (she was kicked out by nurses).Since I had my daughter 3 months ago she has come over a good 10-15 times and has literally only held my kid twice. She just follows my husband around everywhere and still tries to get him to leave with her to go do chores/tasks for her (changing tires, changing oil, fixing her computer, moving around her house, etc etc etc). And honestly none of that bothers me nearly as much as her comments about how my daughter looks nothing like me and looks exactly like HER and my husband. For a bit of context, my husband looks nothing like his mom. He is a spitting image of his father. His mom is short, blonde, brown eyes. He is super tall, black hair, green eyes. You can't tell they are related at all. But she insists my daughter looks just like her and my husband and nothing like me. She's made these comments more times than I can count and I just give a \"yeah okay Becky\" and leave it.But yesterday I hosted a dinner for the family and obviously invited her. She shows up with a scrapbook album with a bunch of photos of her and my husband from birth to present. She was showing/telling everyone who would listen that my daughter was \"basically not even mine if you go off of looks\". My husband spoke up a few times with a clipped \"she actually looks just like my wife\" but his mom didn't acknowledge him. But then she got to my mom and my mom, being a \"no bullshit\" woman, said \"Are you blind or are you just being ignorant? That girl looks just like my daughter and nothing like you. Kinda weird to me that you are desperately pushing the narrative that the baby looks like your son AND you considering your son looks nothing like you either.\" No one in the house said anything but a few of them were chuckling. My husband also didn't say anything but he looked more like a deer in headlights than anything. My MIL then left. She group texted my husband and I later on saying she will never forgive us for not defending her against my mom \"making a scene and embarrassing her in front of everyone.\" I don't feel bad. My husband does. AITA?ETA: She has 4 kids. My husband is the youngest (he's 27). Her two daughters have 1 child each, both 12yo girls. Her other son has 5 kids. She takes her daughters kids once a month. She has never made a conscious effort with any of her other sons kids, outside of his oldest (9f). She doesn't act like this with her other kids at all. She acts uninterested all together. Ages: (not sure if it's relevant) MIL is 61. My mom is 44. My husband and I are both 27.",

She was too late for this year, but next years' is a 2 night trip to Philadelphia.One problem: no more than 6 people can share a hotel room, and there are now 37 girls that would need one. We found out that there's a group of 4 'day-only' kids (3 girls, 1 boy) that actually do stay overnight, at the same hotel even, they just don't do it through the school.The four aren't super well liked and there have been bullying issues, especially against the boy, but they're friends with each other, so the parents banded together and decided to just fund and chaperone them themselves to avoid any issues. They do two rooms: one for the kids, and one for whichever parent goes.They've reached out and offered to let my daughter share with them. She wants to do it. I'm not comfortable. Coed sleepovers are not acceptable. It's completely inappropriate.We've been back and forth with this for weeks. The verdict is clear. There's no open room she can get into through the school, they're not getting her a single room, we can't afford to do anything similar to the other independent group, and we just can't accept a coed sleepover. Going is not an option.She's devastated and begging me to reconsider. She says it's my fault that she even had to transfer schools sophmore year and that we've had to move so much that this is the first time we're going to be somewhere for multiple years. I think we need to pass, but now my husband is starting to waffle and say that maybe we should consider making an exception because everything has been hard on her and this is a major school tradition (and opportunity for her to make friends).",
